## 📌 Abstract
This project investigates the application of machine learning algorithms for the binary classification of heart disease. Using the UCI Cleveland dataset, we implemented and compared five algorithms: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and ANN.

## 📊 Key Results
According to our comparative analysis:
- **Best Model:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Highest Accuracy:** **91.80%**
- **Analysis:** We evaluated models both with and without PCA. While PCA reduced dimensionality, KNN without PCA provided the most reliable diagnostic performance.
